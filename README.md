[servicetable.ingo.au](https://servicetable.ingo.au/)

This is a joke service desk webapp, made to be very not user friendly

# Please read through this first before you start using it

## How to get the most out of this
* Try the AI—ask it a support question or something
* Consult the AI about how it really feels about gork
* Consult the AI about existence
* Create an account (I seriously won't sell your data, and it's just stored in a Neon DB and not sent anywhere else)
* Try using the password `Gork123!` (which is my password) to sign up for an account
* Do a password reset (you can use `me@ingo.au`)
* Submit feedback (ok fine you cant)
* Try and create a ticket
* Look at the resources
* Try dark mode
* Sign out


## Warnings
* A lot of text is unreadable
* Uses a lot of resources
* Will request camera, mic, midi, location, screen sharing permissions—you can ignore them, they arent used
* Password are stored plaintext—dont put anything sensetive in
* Expect very bad ui/ux
* Maybe Epilepsy warning (when scrolling)

## AI Usage
I used AI to generate AI looking text. This is intentional, because part of the bad UI theme of this project is about how companies just write stuff with AI.

All AI generated content is marked with a comment block.

Also there is an AI generated button, which was created by repeatedly telling claude to "make it look better." This is the only vibe coded part of the project, and a bit of a joke about companies putting, AI into everything, no matter how outdate.

## Everything after here is a joke

* TailwindCSS
* Emotion
* MUI
* Ant Design
* GSAP
* Framer motion

### Password are stored plaintext
Storing passwords plaintext improves performance as it eliminates the need for encryption and decryption processes. It also makes password recovery easier and faster.

## Security
* Unique passwords - You cannot have the same password as another user.
* Automatic session termination - Sessions are automatically terminated after a certain period of inactivity.
* Strict password requirements
* I probably won't look in the database and leak your password
* One factor authentication
