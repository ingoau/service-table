# Service Table
This is a joke service desk webapp, made to be very not user friendly

## How to get the most out of this
* Try the AI—ask it a support question or something
* Consult the AI about how it really feels about gork
* Consult the AI about existence
* Create an account (I seriously won't sell your data, and it's just stored in a Neon DB and not sent anywhere else)
* Try using the password `Gork123!` (which is my password) to sign up for an account
* Do a password reset (you can use `me@ingo.au`)
* Submit feedback (ok fine you cant)
* Try and create a ticket
* Look at the resources
* Try dark mode
* Sign out

Everything after here is a joke

### Password are stored plaintext
Storing passwords plaintext improves performance as it eliminates the need for encryption and decryption processes. It also makes password recovery easier and faster.

## Security
* Unique passwords - You cannot have the same password as another user.
* Automatic session termination - Sessions are automatically terminated after a certain period of inactivity.
* Strict password requirements
* I probably won't look in the database and leak your password
* One factor authentication
