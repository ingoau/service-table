          We’re moving to an AI-first approach for documentation and support.
          🤖✨ That means you’ll see smarter, faster help options built right
          into our docs—so you can get answers, troubleshooting steps, and
          guidance in seconds. 📚⚡ Our support experience will also shift
          toward AI-powered assistance as the first stop, with a clear path to a
          human when needed. 🙋♂️✅ The goal is simple: quicker resolutions,
          more consistent answers, and better self-serve support—without losing
          access to the team when it matters.

          you’ll need to meet the new (stronger) rules. 💪 We’ve also made
          passwords unique per user—meaning you can’t use the same password as
          another user in the system. 🚫🔁 Accounts that don’t meet these

      <h2>Support for Failsforce Service Table</h2>

      <div className="w-screen p-4 bg-blue-100 rounded-full relative z-10">
        <p>
          Welcome to the Failsforce Service Table support site—your central
          place for help, guidance, and practical answers for using the platform
          day to day. Whether you’re setting things up for the first time,
          standardising workflows across teams, integrating with existing
          systems, or troubleshooting something urgent, this site is built to
          help you get from “stuck” to “solved” with minimal friction and
          maximum clarity.
        </p>

        <h2>Start where you are</h2>

        <p>
          People come here with different goals, so we’ve organised support
          around common entry points:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Learn the basics: key concepts, terminology, and how Service Table
            fits into your process
          </li>
          <li>
            Configure with confidence: permissions, settings, and recommended
            defaults
          </li>
          <li>
            Run operations smoothly: day-to-day workflows, quality checks, and
            admin tips
          </li>
          <li>
            Troubleshoot issues: symptom-based guides, known issues, and
            recovery steps
          </li>
          <li>
            Improve over time: best practices, templates, and rollout patterns
            that scale
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Get answers your way (browse or ask)</h2>

        <p>
          If you prefer browsing, you’ll find curated guides designed to be
          useful quickly—short sections, checklists, and examples rather than
          long, generic pages. If you already know what you’re trying to do, you
          can jump straight into task-focused topics and collections that map to
          real workflows, not just product menus.
        </p>

        <h2>Ask a question, get a tailored answer</h2>

        <p>
          We replaced traditional documentation with an AI chat experience so
          you can describe what you’re trying to accomplish in plain language
          and get clear, step-by-step guidance tailored to your context—your
          setup, constraints, and desired outcome. The chat supports how real
          troubleshooting works: ask follow-ups, paste an error message, clarify
          what you’ve already tried, and refine the solution iteratively without
          restarting your search or losing the thread. When it matters, it can
          also link back to underlying references so you can verify details,
          share a source internally, or keep decisions transparent.
        </p>

        <h2>Workflows, templates, and best practices</h2>

        <p>
          Failsforce Service Table works best when processes are consistent and
          repeatable. That’s why we include templates, recommended patterns, and
          practical examples you can adapt to your team. Expect guidance on safe
          changes, rollout approaches, and the operational habits that prevent
          recurring issues, along with callouts for common pitfalls and how to
          avoid them.
        </p>

        <h2>Troubleshooting that’s incident-ready</h2>

        <p>
          When something breaks, speed and precision matter. Our troubleshooting
          content is organised around symptoms and outcomes: what you’re seeing,
          what it usually means, how to confirm the cause, and what to do next
          to recover safely. Where relevant, we include validation steps so you
          can confirm the fix and reduce the chance of the issue returning.
        </p>

        <h2>Help us improve</h2>

        <p>
          This support experience is designed to improve continuously. If
          something is unclear, missing, or outdated—or if you had to work too
          hard to get an answer—tell us. Your feedback helps us improve
          guidance, keep references current, and make Failsforce Service Table
          easier to use over time.
        </p>

        <h2>Need more help?</h2>

        <p>
          If you can’t find what you need, use the chat and share a bit of
          context (what you were doing, what you expected, what happened
          instead, and any error text). The more specific you are, the faster we
          can help you get to a reliable solution.
        </p>
